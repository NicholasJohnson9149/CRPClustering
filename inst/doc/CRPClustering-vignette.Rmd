## Abstract
Clustering is a scientific method which finds the clusters of data. And lots of methods are traditionally researched for long terms. Bayesian Nonparametric is a statistics which can treat models having infinite parameters. Chinese Restaurant Process is used in order to compose Dirichlet Process. The Clustering which uses Chinese Restaurant Process does not need to decide a number of clusters in advance. This algorithm automatically adjusts it. And this package can calculate clusters in addition to entropy as ambiguity of clusters.

## Introduction
Clustering is a traditional method in order to find clusters of data. And lots of methods are invented for several decades. The most popular method is called as K-mean[@Hartigan1979]. K-mean is an algorithmic way in order to search clusters of data. But its method needs to decide a number of clusters in advance. So if the data is both high dimensions and a complex, deciding accurate numbers of clusters is difficult. And normal bayesian methods are too. For that reason, Bayesian Nonparametric methods are gradually important as computers are faster. In this package, we implement Chinese Restaurant Process Clustering (CRP)[@Pitman1995]. CRP can compose infinite dimensional parameters as Dirichlet Process[@Ferguson1973]. It acts like a customers who sit at tables in a restaurant and has a probability to sit at a new table. As result, Its model always automates Clustering. And we add the method which calculates entropy[@Elliott1999] of clusters into this package. It can check ambiguity of the result. Then we explain the Clustering model and how to use it in detail. finally, an example is explained.

## Background
#### Chinese Restaurant Process
Chinese Restaurant Process is a metaphor looks like customers sit at a table in Chinese restaurant. All customers except for $x_i$ have already sat at finite tables. A new customer $x_i$ will sit at either a table which other customers have already sat at or a new table. A new customer tends to sit at a table which has a number of customers more than other tables. A probability equation is given by    

$$
\begin{split}
  &p(z_i = k | x_{1:n},z^{\backslash i}_{1:n},\alpha,\mu_0,\rho_0,a_0,b_0)\\
  &= \begin{cases}
    p(x_i | \mu_k, \tau) \times \frac{n^{\backslash i}_{k}}{n - 1 + \alpha} \qquad if \quad k \in K^{K^{+}}(Z^{\backslash i}_{1:n})\\
    p(x_i | \mu_k, \tau) \times \frac{\alpha}{n - 1 + \alpha} \qquad  \mu_k \sim N(\mu_0,(\tau \rho_0)^{-1} I) \qquad if \quad k = |K^{+}(Z^{\backslash i}_{1:n})| + 1
  \end{cases}
\end{split}
$$

$n^{\backslash i}_{k}$ expresses the number of the customers at a table $k$. And $\alpha$ is a concentration parameter.

#### Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for CRP Clustering
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) are algorithmic methods[@Liu1994] to sample from posterior distributions. If conditional posterior distributions are given by models, it is the best way in order to acquire parameters as posterior distributions. The algorithm for this package is given by  

Lots of iterations continue on below.

i) Sampling $z_i$ for each $i$ $(i = 1,2, \cdots,n)$

$$
\begin{split}
  &p(z_i = k | x_{1:n},z^{\backslash i}_{1:n},\alpha,\mu_k,\mu_0,\tau,\rho_0)
 = \begin{cases}
    p(x_i | \mu_k, \tau) \times \frac{n^{\backslash i}_{k}}{n - 1 + \alpha} \\
    p(x_i | \mu_k, \tau) \times \frac{\alpha}{n - 1 + \alpha} \qquad  \mu_k \sim N(\mu_0,(\tau \rho_0)^{-1} I)
  \end{cases}\\\\
  &z_i \sim Multi(p(z_i =1),p(z_i=2),\cdots,p(z_i=\infty))\\
\end{split}
$$

ii) Sampling $u_k$ for each $k$ $(k = 1,2, \cdots ,\infty)$

$$
\begin{split}
  \mu_k \sim p(\mu_k | x_{1:n},z_{1:n},\tau,\mu_0,\rho_0) = N(\mu_k | \frac{n_k}{n_k + \rho_0}\bar{x_k} + \frac{\rho_0}{n_k + \rho_0}\mu_0,(\tau(n_k + \rho_0))^{-1} I) \\
  \bar{x_k} = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum^{n}_{i=1} \delta(z_i = k)x_i
\end{split}
$$

First several durations of iterations which are called burn_in are error ranges. For that reason, burn_in durations are abandoned.

#### Cluster Entropy
Entropy expresses ambiguity of Clustering. As the result of simulation, data $x_i$ joins in a particular table. From the total numbers $n_k$ of the particular table $k$ at the last iteration, a probability $p_k$ at each cluster $k$ is calculated. The entropy equation is given by

$$
\begin{split}
  H(x) = -\sum^{\infty}_{k=1}\frac{n_k}{n} \log_{2}\frac{n_k}{n}
\end{split}
$$

## Installation
If download from GitHub, you can use devtools by the commands:

```
> library(devtools)
> install_github("jirotubuyaki/CRPClustering")
```

Once the packages are installed, it needs to be made accessible to the current R session by the commands:

```
> library(CRPClustering)
```

For online help facilities or the details of a particular command (such as the function crp_gibbs) you can type:

```
> help(package="CRPClustering")
```

## Method
#### Calculating Methods for CRP Clustering

```
> z_result <- crp_gibbs(data, mu=c(0,0), sigma=0.5, sigma_table=12,
                        alpha=1.0, ro_0=0.1, burn_in=10, iteration=100)

```

This method calculates CRP Clustering.  
Let's args be  

*  data : a matrix of data for Clustering. Rows are data $i$ and cols are dimensions of data.
*  mu : numbers of center points of data. If data is 3 dimensions, a vector of 3 elements like "c(2,4,7)".
*  sigma : a number of data variance.
*  sigma_table : a number of table position variance.
*  alpha : a number of a CRP concentrate rate.
*  ro_0 : a number of a CRP mu change rate.
*  burn_in : iteration numbers of burn in.
*  iteration : iteration numbers.

Let's return be  

*  z_result : a vector expresses cluster numbers for each data $i$.

#### Visualization Methods

```
> crp_graph_2d(data, z_result)
```

This method exhibits a two dimensional graph for the method "crp_gibbs".  
Let's args be  

*  data : a matrix of data for Clustering. Rows are data $i$ and cols are dimensions of data.
*  z_result : a vector expresses cluster number for each data $i$. And the output of the method "crp_gibbs".   

## Example
Data is generated from three Normal distributions and $\mu_0 = (-1,1)$ , $\mu_1 = (-1.3,-1.3)$ , $\mu_2 = (1, -1)$ and $\sigma_0 = 0.3$ , $\sigma_1 = 0.02$ , $\sigma_2 = 0.3$. The result is plotted as a graph and each data joins in any cluster. The graph is given by below.

```{r fig.width=3.4,fig.height=2.7,fig.align="center",echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("./image2.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```
